## Hide Volume Hide Plane
[![Nuget Published](https://github.com/TaleSpire-Modding/HideVolumeHidePlane/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TaleSpire-Modding/HideVolumeHidePlane/actions/workflows/release.yml)

Hide volumes have the tendency to block view/usage of other hidevolumes whilst using TaleSpire. This plugin helps GMs to gain better access to HideVolumes that would otherwise be blocked by higher hide volumes.

## Installing With R2ModMan
This package is designed specifically for R2ModMan and Talespire. You can install them via clicking on "Install with Mod Manager" or using the r2modman directly.

## GM Usage
The Hideplane that's used to hide tiles and prop now automatically adjusts the visibility of hide volumes dependent on the slider. This means the cut away can also cut these away without impeeding the functionality. For reference, the cutaway occurs if the top of the hide volume is above the hide plane height.
